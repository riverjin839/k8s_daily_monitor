"""Batch job executors.

To add a new batch job type:

1. Create a module in this package, e.g. `my_job.py`.
2. Subclass `BatchJobExecutor`, set `job_type = "my_job"`, and implement `run()`.
3. Decorate the class with `@register_executor` (or call `register_executor(cls)`).
4. Import the module in `app/services/batch_jobs/__init__.py` so the decorator
   side-effect runs at import time.

The router (`/api/v1/batch-jobs/types`) auto-discovers registered executors
and the UI surfaces them as selectable options when creating a job.
